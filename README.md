# lc3-project

This is a test score calculator written in Assembly via LC-3. 

Issues still in the program:
- Cannot input '100' as a score.
- Cannot enter a single-digit as a single-digit. Have to input with a leading zero ('01', '02', '03', etc).
- Single-digit scores can lead to wonky results
      - EXAMPLE: If '05' and '18' are scores, the minimum score shown will be '18'
